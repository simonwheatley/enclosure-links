# Enclosure Links

* Contributors: simonwheatley

Appends links to the end of your posts for any URLs from enclosures which aren't linked already.

## Description

If there are any enclosure URLs which are not included in the body of the post, this plugin will append links to the end of the post with the text "download (audio/mp3)", etc. Note that the URL needs to match exactly or it will be appended, e.g. `http://example.com/some-stream.mp3?source=rss` does not match `http://example.com/some-stream.mp3?source=twitter`.

This is a workaround for WordPress trac ticket [#10511](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10511).
